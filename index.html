        Hi! I'm Matthew Lindsey, a Computer Science major at West Virginia University with an emphasis in Cybersecurity. I'm passionate about 
        technology because it's a constantly evolving field, and there's always something new to learn that keeps it exciting and motivating. I've been working 
        on web applications, and I'm actively seeking opportunities to expand my skills in software development, whether it's on the frontend, backend, or both. 
        I enjoy being creative and troubleshooting different ways to build web applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing to users. Most 
        of my recent work involves building web apps, and I'm always looking for new challenges to sharpen both my frontend and backend development skills.
